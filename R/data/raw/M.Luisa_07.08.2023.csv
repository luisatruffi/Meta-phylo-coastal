I do not know which sample size should be used. In table 3 authors inform degrees of freedom and that could help us determine sample size. Still, I (Camila) find really hard to do so because the residual error of random factor is missing. It would take a lot of study for us to understand this. For now, let's use sample size as the number of frames in the 3 transects per succesional stage (considering the proportion of frames with and without Empetrum described in the beginning of results section).
